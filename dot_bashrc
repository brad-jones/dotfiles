# We do pretty much all the work to configure our shell inside our rc file,
# this means some of the work will be duplicated for any given login session
# everytime a new non-login interactive shell is started. In practical terms I
# can't see this being a major issue.

# to, if every shell kept adding to it, it would get very long. So we will have
# a seperate file that handles this for us.
. $HOME/.path;

# Then because we like to keep things nice and neat we will
# have another file for all other environment variables.
